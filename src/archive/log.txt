Problems with original method:
 - 

Problems with canny method:
 - Too many spurious lines
 - Cell edges often have numerous layers (the algorithm can't know enough to isolate one of them)
 - Strong edges that are not on edge (such as edge-touching nucleus) often mess up results

Problems with pure edge detection:
HK:
 - Highly inaccurate

LK:
 - Accurate, but not good for large differences

PyrLK:
 - Too slow
 - Since points are considered individually, makes lots of local errors

PyrLK with predefined path:
 - Errors accumulate, causing large curve errors over time
 - This can be patched by rejecting large deformations

<Above> & Kalman filter:
 - 

Problems with Active contour method:
 -
