Recent modifications:

I wasn't satisfied with my previous energy penalty functions, so I changed them to a very simple threshold penalty: If the path doesn't deform, there is no penalty. If the path segment deforms at all, we incur a penalty. This penalty is the same regardless of the amount of deformation (tdot_subtract_energy_edge2). This is the *only* bias in the algorithm, and different penalty values can be tried to remove this bias as much as possible.

Also, when preparing to simplify the path at the beginning of each iteration, previously, vertices that formed acute angles were sometimes removed. I didn't want this to happen, so I added a safeguard to the path simplification algorithm where only path segments that form obtuse angles will get truncated (path_simplify_smart). The relevant angle threshold can be set manually (ANGLE_THRESHOLD).
